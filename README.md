# Eye Exercise

<img src= "Eyes.png" width='300'/>

## Description
The result of this exercise was an animation of eyes following your cursor as it moves around the screen. This was completed using JavaScript HTML and CSS. 
## How to Run
If you download all the files and contain them in the same directory, you can run this animation locally by loading the index.html file onto your browser. 
## Future Improvements
There aren't any future improvements I plan on making at this time but if I decide to return to this exercise in the future I might play around with the image my cursor's movement manipulates. I.e. hair instead of eyes, or something entirely different like a bumble bee that follows the cursor.
